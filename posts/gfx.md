>The graphics of the application is generated by a flocking algorithm, a simulation that imitates the flight patterns of large groups of birds.  As the user moves their hand closer to the webcam the flocking simulation is drawn towards the same point, causing thousands of individual points to cluster around your hand when placed against the screen.

The architecture for the graphics engine primarily comes from the MCD api.  While there are a number of object that make up the engine the core of its power comes from the Vector3D and Entity Classes.  A top level Entity called simulation is used to cascade all update and renders across a graph with the simulation being the top level parent.

The flocking algorithm was implemented following pseudocode found [here](http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html)
